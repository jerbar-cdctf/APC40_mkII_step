# Step Sequencer Implementation Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Updated Note Length Buttons
- **Changed note lengths** to: 1/2 bar (2 beats), 8 bars (32 beats), 4 bars (16 beats), 2 bars (8 beats), 1 bar (4 beats), 1/4 bar (1 beat), 1/8th bar (0.5 beats), 1/16th bar (0.25 beats)
- Track select buttons now control these 8 note length options
- Orange LED indicates the currently selected note length

### 2. Note Duration Clipping
- Notes that extend beyond the loop end are automatically clipped
- The note is placed but its duration stops at the loop boundary
- Implemented in `_on_matrix_button` method (lines 763-770)

### 3. Beat Position Indicator
- **Visual playhead feedback**: The current beat column flashes to show playback position
- **Red flash** for empty note positions (no note present)
- **Yellow flash** (red+green mix) for active note positions (note is present)
- Automatically restores normal LED state after beat moves to next column
- Implemented in `_update_blink` method with proper color handling

### 4. Scene Launch Button Functions
- Each scene launch button controls a drum row function
- **Press scene button** to cycle through function colors:
  - **RED**: Clear all notes for this drum
  - **YELLOW**: Copy all notes for this drum
  - **ORANGE**: Paste copied notes to this drum
  - **PURPLE**: Fill with quarter notes on every beat
  - **DARK PURPLE**: Fill with eighth notes
  - **BROWN**: Fill with 16th notes
  - **DARK BROWN**: Fill with whole notes (quarter notes on every position)
- Button LED shows which function is selected (by color)
- Functions are separate from MPE functionality

### 5. Stop All Clips Button
- **Cycles through drums**: Press to select the next drum sequentially
- Wraps around from drum 15 back to drum 0
- Updates grid display to show newly selected drum
- Separate from MPE functionality

### 6. Master Button
- **Executes the selected function** for the currently selected drum
- Clears the function assignment after execution
- Turns off the scene button LED after function completes
- Refreshes the grid to show changes

### 7. Function Implementations
All functions work on the currently selected drum:

#### Clear (RED)
- Removes all notes for the drum within the loop length
- Uses Live 12 API `remove_notes_extended` when available

#### Copy (YELLOW)
- Copies all notes from the drum to an internal buffer
- Preserves note timing, duration, velocity, and pressure

#### Paste (ORANGE)
- Pastes previously copied notes to the selected drum
- Transposes notes to the target drum pitch
- Uses the target drum's velocity and pressure settings
- Does nothing if no notes are copied

#### Fill Quarter Notes (PURPLE)
- Places a quarter note (1 beat duration) at every beat position
- Fills from 0.0 to loop end

#### Fill Eighth Notes (DARK PURPLE)
- Places eighth notes (0.5 beat duration) at every eighth note position
- Creates a continuous pattern of eighth notes

#### Fill 16th Notes (BROWN)
- Places sixteenth notes (0.25 beat duration) at every 16th position
- Creates the densest pattern

#### Fill Whole Notes (DARK BROWN)
- Places whole notes (4 beat duration) at every whole note position
- One note per bar

## Technical Details

### New Instance Variables
- `_last_blink_col`: Tracks the last blinking column for cleanup
- `_blink_on`: Toggle state for blink effect
- `_copied_notes`: Buffer for copy/paste functionality
- `_drum_functions`: Dictionary tracking which functions are assigned to which drums
- `_current_function_color`: Current function selection
- LED color constants: `_LED_RED`, `_LED_YELLOW`, `_LED_ORANGE`, `_LED_PURPLE`, `_LED_DARK_PURPLE`, `_LED_BROWN`, `_LED_DARK_BROWN`
- `_function_colors`: List of available function colors for cycling

### New Methods
- `_on_scene_launch_button()`: Handles scene button presses to cycle functions
- `_on_stop_all_button()`: Cycles through drum selection
- `_on_master_button()`: Executes the selected function
- `_clear_drum_notes()`: Clears all notes for a drum
- `_copy_drum_notes()`: Copies notes to buffer
- `_paste_drum_notes()`: Pastes notes from buffer
- `_fill_quarter_notes()`, `_fill_eighth_notes()`, `_fill_sixteenth_notes()`, `_fill_whole_notes()`: Fill pattern methods
- `_fill_pattern()`: Generic pattern fill implementation
- `_render_scene_function_leds()`: Updates scene button LEDs to show function assignments
- `_clear_note_length_leds()`: Clears track select button LEDs on exit

### Modified Methods
- `__init__()`: Added new button parameters and instance variables
- `_enter()`: Added scene function LED rendering and playhead tick scheduling
- `_exit()`: Added note length LED clearing
- `_update_blink()`: Enhanced with note-aware color flashing
- `_refresh_grid()`: Added scene function LED rendering

### Button Mapping
- **Scene Launch Buttons (5)**: Function selection per drum row
- **Stop All Clips Button**: Cycle through drums
- **Master Select Button**: Execute function
- **Track Select Buttons (8)**: Note length selection
- **Clip Stop Buttons (8)**: Loop length selection (unchanged)

## Usage Workflow

1. **Enter sequencer mode**: Press User button
2. **Select note length**: Press one of the 8 track select buttons
3. **Add/remove notes**: Press matrix pads
4. **Assign function to drum**: Press scene launch button for that drum row (cycles through colors)
5. **Cycle drum selection**: Press Stop All Clips button
6. **Execute function**: Press Master button (executes function for currently selected drum)
7. **Beat indicator**: Watch the playhead flash red (empty) or yellow (active) as it moves

## Files Modified
1. `StepSequencer.py`: Added all new functionality
2. `APC40_MkII_step.py`: Updated StepSequencer initialization with new buttons

## Compatibility
- Uses Live 12 API when available (`add_new_notes`, `get_notes_extended`, `remove_notes_extended`)
- Falls back to older API for compatibility with Live 11
- All functionality wrapped in try/except blocks for stability
